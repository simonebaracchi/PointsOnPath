# PointsOnPath

Autodesk Fusion 360 plugin for automatically placing points on vertexes with a set distance. Used for drawing sewing points on models.

Download all files in this repo, place them in the `%appdata%\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\Scripts` (for example it might be `C:\Users\Simone\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\Scripts\PointsOnPath`), and restart Fusion 360.

Then select a vertex, open the `Create` menu and choose `Points on path`. Then you can specify a distance between points. If the vertex length is not a multiple of the desired distance, an error will be shown.

This project is to be considered experimental.
